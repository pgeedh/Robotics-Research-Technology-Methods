# RRTM Assessment 1: Critical Evaluation of Robotics Research

## Project Overview
This repository contains the portfolio of critical evaluations for the Robotics Research Technology and Methods (RRTM) module, specifically for Assessment 1. This assessment involves weekly reports that critically evaluate the robotics research presented in seminars and reading group sessions.

### Contents
- **Weekly Reports**: Each report critically evaluates up to two RRTM seminars and two research papers discussed in the reading groups.
- **Seminar Summaries**: Brief summaries and reflections on the key research areas and challenges discussed in the seminars.
- **Research Paper Reviews**: Summaries and critical analyses of the research papers presented in the reading groups.

# RRTM Assessment 2: Research Proposal for SLAM in Autonomous Mobile Robots

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the research proposal for the dissertation project under the Robotics Research Technology and Methods (RRTM) module, specifically for Assessment 2. The project focuses on developing and validating an advanced SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operating in complex, machinery-dense environments.

### Contents
- **Aims and Objectives**: Clearly defines the scope and goals of the project.
- **Motivation**: Establishes the need for the project and its potential impact on the field.
- **Literature Review**: Evaluates the state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies related to SLAM and AMRs.
- **Impact Assessment**: Considers the social, environmental, economic, political, legal, and ethical implications of the project.
- **Risk Register**: Identifies potential risks and outlines mitigation strategies.
- **Timeline**: A Gantt chart dividing the project into subtasks with appropriate time allocations.
- **Sustainability Assessment**: An appendix focusing on the sustainability of the materials and processes used in the project.
